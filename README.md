# Climbers of Verdon

## The map

The central part of the map is randomly formed out of hexagonal tiles.
Each tile belongs to a specific type of terrain.
The border is made by connecting 6 side pieces that each contain 1 or 2 training camps.

Each corner of a tile represents a _location_ on the map
(corners that meet each other are in the same location).
Tile sides that connect nearby locations represent _paths_.

## Types of terrain

1. 3 Mountains -- produce ropes.
2. 4 Big walls -- produce nuts.
3. 4 Cliffs -- produce bolts.
4. 3 Boulder fields -- produce crashpads.
5. 4 Caves -- produce chalk.
6. 1 Grass -- doesn't produce any resources.

## Shops and trading

Locations that touch the edge pieces can have training camps on them.
Each training camp is located between two edge locations
and is accessible from both of them.
The training camps allow exchanging resources.
There are 9 of them in total: 1 for each resource type
(they give 1 unit of any resource for 2 units of their dedicated resource)
and 4 universal ones
(they give 1 unit of any resource for 3 units of any resource).

It's always possible to trade any resource for any at the bank at the rate of 4:1.

## Starting the game

Each player starts with two projects and two fixed ropes next to them.
They can then pick two resources from the types produced by the tiles adjacent
to the locations of their projects.

## Structure of a turn

1. Roll two dice to determine the income
   (see **Income from projects and routes** below).

2. Perform any of the following actions as many times as you want:

  * Put fixed ropes to access other locations,
  * Establish projects in the locations to which you have adjacent fixed ropes,
  * Climb your own project (it becomes a route),
  * Climb other player's route,
  * Buy and use development cards,
  * Trade resources with other players,
  * Trade resources at training camps or at the bank.

### Fixed ropes

The cost of putting down a fixed rope is **1 rope and 1 bolt**.
New fixed rope be placed adjacent to your own project, ascent or fixed rope.

### Project

A project can be established at any location that doesn't have other projects
or ascents closer than 2 tile edges away. The cost of a project is
**1 nut, 1 bolt, 1 rope and 1 crashpad**.

When a project is established, choose the tile on which it will be.
This determines the cost of climbing it later
and the amounts of resources that it produces.

### Climbing routes

You can climb your own project. This converts it to a route.
The cost of the climb depends on the type of terrain of the tile on which the project is:

* Mountain -- **3 ropes, 1 chalk, 1 nut**,
* Big wall -- **3 nuts, 1 rope, 1 bolt**,
* Cliff -- **3 bolts, 1 nut, 1 crashpad**,
* Boulder -- **3 crashpads, 1 bolt, 1 chalk**,
* Cave -- **3 chalk, 1 rope, 1 crashpad**.

### Repeating routes

You can repeat another player's route to which you have access.
The cost of repeating is as follows:

* Mountain -- **3 ropes, 1 chalk**,
* Big wall -- **3 nuts, 1 chalk**,
* Cliff -- **3 bolts, 1 chalk**,
* Boulder -- **3 crashpads, 1 chalk**,
* Cave -- **3 chalk, 1 chalk**.

Repeating gives both the owner of the route and the repeater one victory point.

### Publicity cards

You can buy a publicity card for **1 nut, 1 crashpad, 1 chalk**.
Publicity cards symbolise spending time on communication, competitions and other stuff.

The most common one is **fan club** (there are 14 of them).
You can play a fan club card to move the access restrictions token.

The other ones are:

* 2 x **sponsorship** (take 2 resources of any type),
* 2 x **expedition** (2 fixed ropes for free),
* 2 x **community support** (pick randomly 1 resource from each player,
  2 if they have over 5),
* 2 x **friendly rivalry** (choose a project of another player,
  you each roll one die, whoever rolls a bigger number gets a route in place
  of that project, in case of draw nothing happens),
* **free solo climb** (1 victory point),
* **write a book** (1 victory point),
* **open a gym** (1 victory point),
* **competition victory** (1 victory point),
* **classic climb** (1 victory point).

## Income from projects and routes

At the beginning of the game each tile except for grass is assigned a number
between 2 and 12 by randomly distributing the number tokens between tiles.
There are 18 tokens, two for each number from 2 to 12 except for 7.

At the beginning of each player's turn they roll two dice to produce
a number between 2 and 12. Players that have projects in locations that
are adjacent to any tile with the rolled number get 1 unit of the resource
that the tile produces. Players that have routes in locations that are
adjacent to any tile with the rolled number get 2 units of the resource
that the tile produces. A project or climb that is located on the tile
with the rolled number produces twice the normal amount of resources.

## Access restrictions token

Access restriction token starts on the grass tile. A player that rolls a 
7 can move the token to another tile.

The area with the access restriction token doesn't produce any resources.
Projects cannot be established there and no climbs can be done on that tile.

## Scoring

Players get 1 point for each project they own
and 2 points for each route they own.
They also get 1 point for each repeat of a route they've done
as well as for each repeat of their route.
Players can also get points for certain publicity cards (see above)
and from emblems (see below).

The player that gets 13 points first wins the game.

### Emblems

* Whoever has most fan clubs (at least 3) gets **most popular climber** emblem,
  which is worth 2 points.
* Whoever has the longest chain of fixed ropes (at least 5) gets **explorer** emblem,
  which is worth 2 points.
