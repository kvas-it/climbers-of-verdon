# Settlers of Verdon (a.k.a. Climbers of Verdon)

## Types of land

1. High mountains -- produces ropes.
2. Big wall -- produces nuts.
3. Cliffs -- produces bolts.
4. Boulder field -- produces crashpads.
5. Sea cave -- produces chalk.

Obviously depending on what type of climbing you do,
you get sponsored by the companies that are into that stuff
and they give you appropriate gear.

The central tile is a grass field.

## Shops and trading

Some edge locations have shops on them. The shops allow exchanging resources.
There are 9 shops in total: 1 for each resource type (2:1)
and 4 outdoor supermarkets (3:1 any resource).

It's always possible to trade any resource for any at the bank at the rate of 4:1.

## Other items

* Access restriction -- starts in the central tile, moved
  when you roll 7. The area with the access restriction token
  doesn't produce any resources.

## Ascents

Each player starts with two projects and some fixed ropes next to them.
Then they can put fixed ropes to get to other locations and do ascents in
the locations to which they have adjacent fixed ropes.

### Costs

* Fixed rope -- 1 rope, 1 bolt.
* Project -- 1 nut, 1 bolt, 1 rope, 1 crashpad.
* First ascent on your own project -- 2 nuts, 3 chalks.
* Publicity card -- 1 nut, 1 crashpad, 1 chalk.

### Additional types of ascents

We might want to consider other types of ascents.
Just need to figure out how to balance everything.

* FA on someone else's project (stealing a project,
  the owner should be compensated somehow,
  like get to move access restriction token,
  maybe get a victory point) -- ? (more expensive than normal FA,
  maybe needs some sacrifices, maybe it's only allowed if the
  original project has been there for some number of turns).
* Ground up FA (without a project, basically two in one) -- ? (should be expensive
  but maybe a bit cheaper or different than project + FA)
* Repeat on someone else's FA (the FA stays there, repeater gets 1 victory point) -- ?

## Publicity cards

Publicity cards symbolise spending time on communication, competitions and other stuff.

The most common one is **fan club** (there are 14 of them).
You can play a fan club card to move the access restrictions token.

The other ones are:

* 2 x **sponsorship** (take 2 resources of any type),
* 2 x **expedition** (2 fixed ropes for free),
* 2 x **community support** (pick randomly 1 resource from each player,
  2 if they have over 5),
* 2 x **friendly rivalry** (choose a project of another player,
  you each roll one die, whoever rolls a bigger number gets an accent of that project,
  in case of draw nothing happens),
* **free solo climb** (1 victory point),
* **write a book** (1 victory point),
* **open a gym** (1 victory point),
* **competition victory** (1 victory point),
* **hardest climb** (1 victory point).

## Other sources of points

* Whoever has most fan clubs (at least 3) gets **most popular climber** emblem,
  which is worth 2 points.
* Whoever has the longest chain of fixed ropes (at least 5) gets **explorer** emblem,
  which is worth 2 points.
